## 1. Introduction

Phase 3 represents a significant advancement in the InnHotel system, introducing sophisticated business logic and user experience enhancements. The implementation focused on three core areas:

1. **Reservation Workflow Enhancement** - Implementing proper status transitions with validation
2. **Room Availability System** - Preventing double-booking and managing room availability
3. **Employee Role Management** - Expanding role-based access control with audit logging

These features transform the system from a basic CRUD application into a robust hotel management platform with enterprise-grade capabilities.

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### 4.1 Reservation Status Transition System

#### Status Flow Diagram
```
Pending → Confirmed → CheckedIn → CheckedOut
   ↓          ↓
Cancelled  Cancelled
```

#### Business Rules Implemented

1. **From Pending:**
   - Can transition to: Confirmed, Cancelled
   - Cannot skip to CheckedIn or CheckedOut

2. **From Confirmed:**
   - Can transition to: CheckedIn, Cancelled
   - Cannot check in before check-in date
   - Cannot check in after check-out date

3. **From CheckedIn:**
   - Can only transition to: CheckedOut
   - Cannot check out before check-in date

4. **Terminal States:**
   - CheckedOut and Cancelled are terminal states
   - No further transitions allowed

#### Code Example
```csharp
public bool IsValidTransition(ReservationStatus currentStatus, ReservationStatus newStatus)
{
    if (currentStatus == newStatus)
        return true;

    return currentStatus switch
    {
        ReservationStatus.Pending => newStatus is ReservationStatus.Confirmed or ReservationStatus.Cancelled,
        ReservationStatus.Confirmed => newStatus is ReservationStatus.CheckedIn or ReservationStatus.Cancelled,
        ReservationStatus.CheckedIn => newStatus == ReservationStatus.CheckedOut,
        ReservationStatus.CheckedOut => false,
        ReservationStatus.Cancelled => false,
        _ => false
    };
}
```

### 4.2 Room Availability Algorithm

#### Date Overlap Detection
The system uses a sophisticated algorithm to detect date overlaps:

```csharp
private bool DatesOverlap(DateOnly start1, DateOnly end1, DateOnly start2, DateOnly end2)
{
    // Two date ranges overlap if:
    // - start1 is before end2 AND
    // - end1 is after start2
    return start1 < end2 && end1 > start2;
}
```

#### Availability Check Process
1. Filter reservations for the specific room
2. Exclude cancelled and checked-out reservations
3. Check for date overlaps with existing reservations
4. Return availability status

#### Performance Optimization
- Efficient filtering using LINQ
- Early exit on first conflict found
- Support for bulk queries to reduce API calls

### 4.3 Permission System Architecture

#### Permission Categories
1. **Reservations** - View, Create, Update, Delete, CheckIn, CheckOut
2. **Rooms** - View, Create, Update, Delete, UpdateStatus
3. **Guests** - View, Create, Update, Delete
4. **Employees** - View, Create, Update, Delete, ManageRoles
5. **Financial** - ViewReports, ProcessPayments, ViewRevenue
6. **System** - ViewAuditLogs, ManageSettings, ManageBranches

#### Role Definitions

| Role | Description | Key Permissions |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Administrator | Full system access | All permissions |
| Manager | Branch-level management | All except system settings |
| Receptionist | Front desk operations | Reservations, Guests, CheckIn/Out |
| Housekeeper | Room maintenance | View Rooms, Update Room Status |
| Accountant | Financial operations | View Financial Reports, View Revenue |

### 4.4 Audit Logging System

#### Logged Actions
- Create, Update, Delete operations
- Status changes (reservations, rooms)
- Check-in and check-out events
- Payment processing
- Role assignments
- Permission changes

#### Audit Log Structure
```csharp
public class AuditLog
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Action { get; set; }
    public string EntityType { get; set; }
    public int? EntityId { get; set; }
    public string? OldValues { get; set; }
    public string? NewValues { get; set; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
    public string IpAddress { get; set; }
    public string? AdditionalInfo { get; set; }
}
```

### 4.5 Check-In/Check-Out Wizards

#### Check-In Wizard Steps
1. **Guest Verification** - Verify guest identity with ID
2. **Room Assignment** - Confirm room assignments
3. **Payment Verification** - Verify payment received
4. **Special Requests** - Collect any special requests
5. **Complete** - Finalize check-in

#### Check-Out Wizard Steps
