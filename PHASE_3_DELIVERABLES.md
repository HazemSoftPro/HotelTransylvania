## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Deferred to Phase 4
The following features were planned but deferred to Phase 4 for better focus:

1. **Visual Calendar Component**
   - Interactive availability calendar
   - Drag-and-drop booking
   - Color-coded availability

2. **Role-Based UI**
   - Permission-based component rendering
   - Role-based navigation
   - Permission gates

3. **Audit Log Viewer**
   - UI for viewing audit logs
   - Advanced filtering
   - Export functionality

4. **Waitlist Management UI**
   - Waitlist viewer component
   - Priority management
   - Notification system

### Rationale
These features require additional UI work and can be implemented in Phase 4 without affecting core functionality. The backend infrastructure is complete and ready for these features.
